The project is a web-based/appointment scheduler system that brings convenience to patients who visit for medical services. 
Patients can describe the issue briefly before going to the clinic and schedule an appointment. 
The system provides reminders to patients for a follow-up appointment after being consulted. 
Patients can also view prescriptions with specific instructions on when to take medicine (e.g., with food or at bedtime). 
This system will contribute to patient-doctor communication in having effective management of appointments, treatment, and follow-ups.
